        <h2>Homepage</h2>
        <p>This is the homepage of my portfolio website. 
           A portfolio platform as a biomedical engineering student 
           can be a fantastic way to showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments.
           I am at the heart of an exciting field that merges science, technology and health.
           Biomedical engineering plays a crucial role in the design and development of advanced medical equipment,
           as well as in finding innovative solutions to improve healthcare. If you have any questions, 
           projects or specific topics related to biomedical engineering , do not hesitate to share them. 
           I'm here to chat with you about anything that interests you in this area and more! .</p>

            <h3>Project 1 : Portable ECG Monitoring Device for Remote Cardiac Health Tracking </h3>
            <p> This project aimed to develop a portable Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device that enables individuals to track their cardiac health remotely. 
                The device collects real-time ECG data, processes it, and sends alerts to users and healthcare professionals in case of irregularities.</p> </br>  
                
                Technologies Used:

                ECG sensors for data acquisition.
                Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) for data processing.
                Bluetooth module for wireless data transmission.
                Mobile app development (iOS/Android) for user interface and data visualization. </br>
            </br>
                Results:

                The project resulted in a functional prototype of the portable ECG monitoring device, 
                along with a companion mobile app. Users could wear the device comfortably 
                and monitor their cardiac health in real time. The system successfully detected 
                and alerted users to irregular heart rhythms, promoting timely intervention and medical attention.

            <h3>Project 2 : Smart Rehabilitation Glove for Stroke Patients</h3>
            <p> This project aimed to develop a wearable rehabilitation glove equipped with sensors 
                and smart technology to assist stroke patients in regaining hand dexterity 
                and motor skills during their recovery process.</p> </br>

                Technologies Used:

                Flex sensors and accelerometer for hand movement tracking.
                Microcontroller for data processing and control.
                Haptic feedback actuators to provide tactile stimulation.
                Bluetooth connectivity for data transmission and remote monitoring.
                Custom software for data analysis and progress tracking. </br>
            </br>
                Results:
                The project resulted in a functional rehabilitation glove prototype 
                that stroke patients could wear during their recovery. 
                The glove provided real-time guidance and haptic feedback, 
                making rehabilitation exercises more engaging and effective. 
                The associated mobile app allowed patients to monitor 
                their progress and therapists to remotely adjust exercise parameters.
